/* Write a program that demonstrates handling of exceptions in inheritance tree. Create a base
class called “Father” and derived class called “Son” which extends the base class. In Father
class, implement a constructor which takes the age and throws the exception Wrong Age( )
when the input age<0. In Son class, implement a constructor that cases both father and son’s
age and throws an exception if son’s age is >=father’s age.*/
